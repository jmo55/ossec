#This file contains my compiled notes from multiple resources to install and apply the initial configurations for OSSEC.

# Preferably, be in root until completion.
# Note: Web-UI breaks with php8.x
# Distro used Ubuntu 20.04
# Do a manual installation for the server if you want to use MySQL or PostgreSQL

# Update and upgrade the system
su
apt update && apt upgrade -y

# Manual Installation of OSSEC
wget https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/archive/3.7.0.tar.gz
tar -xvzf 3.7.0.tar.gz
cd ossec-hids-3.7.0

# Set an environment variable for DB to output
# You then need to set the DATABASE environment variable and run the "./install.sh" script, to compile OSSEC with the appropriate database support.
# Setting an Environment Variable
# To set an environment variable, the export command is used.

export DATABASE=mysql  # or export DATABASE=pgsql

# If OSSEC had been previously compiled without database support, the files created during the previous build should be removed from the src directory.
# cd src
# make clean

# Once the old files have been removed, the installation can be performed.
DATABASE=mysql ./install.sh  # or DATABASE=pgsql ./install.sh

# Enable Database output in the configuration
# After installation is complete, database support needs to be enabled.
/var/ossec/bin/ossec-control enable database

# If you're not doing a DB install, then just run the install command below
./install.sh

# Answer the installation questions - type LOCAL & for email use root@localhost or your email smtp settings

# Start ossec service
/var/ossec/bin/ossec-control start

# Automatic installation would be good for agent install only
# or
# Installing the server service without MySQL or PostgreSQL setup

# APT Automated Installation on Ubuntu
wget -q -O - https://updates.atomicorp.com/installers/atomic | sudo bash

# Update apt data
sudo apt-get update

# Server
sudo apt-get install ossec-hids-server

# Agent
sudo apt-get install ossec-hids-agent

# Review "Additional_configurations" to continue with basic configuration steps after install.

# Only follow these steps if you are going to add web-ui as well. NOTE: These same steps are in the "web-ui-installation_steps".
