:: = Recommended Installation =

:: OSSEC installation is very simple. It can be done in the
:: fast way (using the script install.sh with the default values)
:: or in the customized way (by hand or by changing the default values
:: in the install.sh script). I REALLY recommend EVERYONE to use the
:: FAST WAY! Only developers or experienced people should use the
:: other methods.

:: Before running the script, make sure your system has the necessary
:: libraries and tools installed:
:: - libssl
:: - libpcre2
:: - libz
:: - make, gcc
:: - libsystemd-dev

:: On a Ubuntu/Debian system, these can be installed with:

# :: Prerequesite Commands; after apt-get update && apt get upgrade -y & switch to root user

apt install libz-dev libssl-dev libpcre2-dev build-essential libsystemd-dev

# :: Prerequesite install web-server && start/enable service

apt install apache2 php

systemctl start apache2

systemctl enable apache2
