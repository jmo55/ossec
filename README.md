For Windows Agent Install:

Next up, download the executable named Agent Windows from https://ossec.github.io/downloads.html. Run through the install wizard with all defaults. It should launch the Ossec Agent Manager when itâ€™s done.

# Docker Compose 

I compiled a docker-compose.yml file to containerize the configurations. This is not an image, I used "ubuntu:apache2" & "atomicorp:ossec-docker" image.

Directory Structure:

/your_project
 - docker-compose.yml
/ services
  / apache2
    - Dockerfile
    -httpd.conf
  / ossec-server
    -Dockerfile
    -ossec.conf
  / agents
    / agent1
       -ossec.conf
    / agent2
       -ossec.conf

Dir & files compressed "ossec_project_compose.tar.gz"

Change the port number in yml file for apache2 container if needed. I had something else exposed to port 80 and used port 8080.

To run docker-compose.yml file within ossec_project dir. Command: docker compose up -d --build
