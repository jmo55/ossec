WINDOWS AGENT

Next up, download the executable named Agent Windows from https://ossec.github.io/downloads.html. Run through the install wizard with all defaults. It should launch the Ossec Agent Manager when itâ€™s done.

# For docker compose container example use folder:"ossec_container_project.tar.gz"

Download folder and extract .tar

tar -xvzf ossec_container_project.tar.gz

copy dir to desired path

run docker-compose.yml file within ossec_project dir.

change port number in yml file for apache2 container if needed. I had something else exposed to port 80 and used port 8080.
