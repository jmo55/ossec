# Installation Types
OSSEC can be installed in an agent/server combination or as a stand-alone system. The stand-alone installation is essentially a server installation without the pieces that interact with agents. The server installation includes the agent functionality for the local system.

# Server
In an OSSEC server/agent installation, the agents pass log messages to the server for processing. Rules and decoders are installed only on the server. Alerts are generated and distributed from the server.

# Agent
OSSEC agents tail the local log files and forward the messages to the OSSEC server. Local file integrity monitoring messages are also forwarded to the server.

# Hybrid
A hybrid installation is both a server and agent. As a server it processes logs for a number of agents, and as an agent it forwards alerts to another server.

# Local
A local, or stand-alone, installation resides entirely on a singular system. It is not associated with a server or agents. Decoders and rules will be stored on a local installation.
